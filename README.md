# Exotiscan Model Transfer Learning

This project aims to develop a transfer learning model for animal image classification using TensorFlow.

## Project Description

This project leverages an animal image dataset to train a transfer learning model. The model uses a pre-trained architecture on a large dataset and fine-tunes its weights to recognize animal species in our dataset.

## Dataset

The animal image dataset can be downloaded from the following link:
